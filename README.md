# tagalog-qali-book

A significant number of Tagalog words begin with the Proto-Austronesian prefix *kali/qali, which are described by Blust (2009:368) as implying a “sensitive connection with the spirit world.” The *kali/qali words present in the modern-day Tagalog language are a legacy of the Tagalog people’s animist past.

The Tagalog *kali/qali words below have been selected from Carl Rubino’s Tagalog-English, English-Tagalog Dictionary (2002).

## Overview

*kali/qali words are widespread among Austronesian languages, and are found from Taiwan to Oceania. The majority of these words are four syllables long (Blust 2001).

Proto-Austronesian reconstructions of interest include *qanitu “spirit, soul” (Zorc) and *balian “shaman” (Blust).
